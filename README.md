# Predicting-Student-Scores
I utilized the SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder and Pipeline libraries and engineered an XGBoost model with optimized hyperparameters. I  computed the cross-validation and root mean squared error scores and produced a local RMSE score of 8.75 and a competition score of 10.49 compared to the top 8.53 score.
